the management of the window must remain smooth: changing to another window, minimizing;

display different wall textures that vary depending on which sido the wall is facing (North, South, East ,West);

set the floor and ceiling color to two different ones;

display the image in a window and respect the following rules:
    -the left and right arrow keys must allow to look left and right in the maze;
    -the W, A, S, D must allow to move the point of view through the maze;
    -pressing ESC must close the window and quit the program cleanly;
    -clicking on the cross on the window's frame must close the window and quit the program cleanly;
    -the use of "images" of the "minilibx" is strongly recommended;

the program must take as a first argument a scene description file with the ".cub" extension;

parsing:
    -the map must be composed of only 6 possible characters: "0" for an empty space, "1" for a wall and "N", "S", "E" or "W" for the player's start position and spawning orientation;
    -the map must be close/surrounded by walls, if not the program must return an error;
    -except for the map content, each type of element can be separated by on or more empty line(s);
    -except for hte map content which always has to be the last, each type of elemtn can be set in any order in the file;
    -except for the map, each type of information from an element can be separated by one or more space(s);
    -the map must be parsed as it looks in the file. Spaces are a valid part of the map and are up to us to handle. We must be able to parse any kind of map, as long as it respects the rules of the map;
    -each element (except the map) first information is the type identifier (composed by one or two character(s)). followed by all specific informations for each object in a strict order such as:
        -North texture:
            NO ./path_to_the_north_texture
        -South texture:
            SO ./path_to_the_south_texture
        -West texture:
            WE ./path_to_the_west_texture
        -East texture:
            EA ./path_to_the_east_texture
        -Floor color:
            F 200,100,0
              R   G   B (colors range is from 0 to 255)
        -Ceiling color:
            C 200,100,0
              R   G   B (colors range is from 0 to 255)
    -if any misconfiguration of any kind is encountered in the map file, the program must exit properly and return "Error\n" followed by an explicit error message of our choice;
